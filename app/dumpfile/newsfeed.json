Like\u2026 really, America?<\/blockquote>\n<p>During his campaign, Trump <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2015\/dec\/07\/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\" target=\"_blank\">vowed to ban Muslims<\/a> from entering and to clamp down hard on the H-1B skilled worker programme. Silicon Valley will find it harder to recruit talented engineers from abroad, and founders looking to shift their businesses to the US might have their plans disrupted.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI feel sad, very sad. Not just for myself but for many American people too who have worked hard for equality and tolerance in their own country,\u201d added Waqas, who\u2019s the co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/themarkhor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Markhor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Plans in disarray<\/h2>\n<p>Similar nervousness was echoed by other entrepreneurs that <em>Tech in Asia<\/em> talked to moments after Trump\u2019s trouncing of Hillary Clinton.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was quite shocked. Like\u2026 really, America?\u201d said Gibran Huzaifa, co-founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/efishery.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\">Efishery<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m a glass half-full kind of guy. So, after I heard the news, I feel that if someone like Trump, a very unlikely figure, can be president of the strongest country in the world, then my startup idea \u2013 as crazy as it is \u2013 can succeed too,\u201d he stated.<\/p>\n<p>Sameer Khan, co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialchamp.io\/\" target=\"_blank\">SocialChamp<\/a>, is left wondering how his impending trip to the US might be affected.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in talks with many experts from the Valley and the next few months are very crucial. We have all heard about the plan Donald Trump has for Muslims, but I wonder whether those comments were just to gain votes. If the government imposes any law that bans our entry it will definitely affect my startup,\u201d he explains.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_344828\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-344828\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/startup-photos-750x536.jpg\" alt=\"Photo credit: startupstockphotos.com\" width=\"750\" height=\"536\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a>startupstockphotos.com<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Hope<\/h2>\n<p>Other startup people exhibited a steely resolve.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Americans voted for a new president, not a new constitution.<\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/game-ventures-entrepreneurship-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Zaki Mahomed<\/a>, a serial entrepreneur who\u2019s now the VP of product at <a href=\"http:\/\/influitive.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Influitive<\/a>, says the whole point of democracy is to accept results you don\u2019t like and move on.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear now that the average person is concerned they\u2019re not sharing the prosperity enjoyed by industries like tech. A constructive response would be to try and fix that instead of fearing everything President Trump will do in the future,\u201d he exhorts.<\/p>\n<p>Zaki believes that the election results could be a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for anyone considering moving to Silicon Valley. Tech ecosystems with proximity to the area \u2013 such as Canada \u2013 could benefit. But he urges founders to buckle up for the ride.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs early-stage startup people we\u2019re used to operating without really too much concern for the broader political landscape and how it affects us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another Silicon Valley-based founder from a Muslim nation, who prefers to remain anonymous, doesn\u2019t think the election will affect his plans in any way.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAmerica\u2019s strength is in its constitution and values on basic human rights, liberty, and individual freedom. And more importantly the belief that if you work hard, you can achieve anything you want regardless of your background. I moved to the US for its values and I don\u2019t think Trump being president will have a direct impact on me because Americans voted for a new president and not for a new constitution. The core of the US is still there and I am very optimistic about my future in this great country.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wifigen.xyz\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wifigen<\/a>\u00a0co-founder Bilal Athar counts American investors as his primary backers. He flies there regularly for work but says the election won\u2019t impact his company.<\/p>\n<p>He does, however, think it\u2019s bad news for Silicon Valley overall.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAround 40 percent of H-1B visas are issued to tech companies and the majority of their hires are from Asia. If there\u2019s cultural discrimination, we\u2019ll see fewer Asians moving to the US and more talent available for local startups,\u201d says Bilal.<\/p>\n",

Photo credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.123rf.com\/profile_estherpoon\">estherpoon \/ 123RF Stock Photo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Mobilized and motivated by Alibaba, China\u2019s Singles Day (11.11) shopping frenzy is spreading to Southeast Asia this year. In 2015, the 11.11th drove US$14.30 billion in online sales in China. In comparison, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined, sold a mere US$5.80 billion in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The growing influence of the Chinese shopping holiday stems from a Pac-Man-like acquisition pattern. After surprising shifts in the market this year, it\u2019s clear that Alibaba wants its shopping cart parked in Southeast Asia. The retail giant invested in Lazada, a company based in the region, earlier this year. Just a few months later, the popular Singaporean ecommerce company acquired local grocery platform, RedMart.<\/p>\n<p>Alibaba\u2019s competitors also have their sights set on the region with JD.com\u2019s launch in Indonesia last year, and US retail giant, Amazon is primed to launch in Singapore in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>With these red flags in place, ecommerce companies in Southeast Asia should amp up their businesses to prepare for even more shopping holidays to come. Whether you are a merchant, reseller, or marketplace, here are some tips that can help maximize returns on the loneliest day of the year.<\/p>\n<h2>Partner up<\/h2>\n<p>Stick to what you\u2019re good at. There is no way one platform or merchant can do everything. Take Lazada for example. During key sales periods last year, the company saw its revenue uplift by six times on November 11 and December 12. Not to mention, there was a 55 percent spike in orders on Black Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the growing consumer base, the company has changed approaches over the years. Instead of trying to do everything in-house, the platform has moved to a partnership model. This model\u00a0allows them to work with specialists who can help with everything from creating content, recommending photographers, to the fulfillment of logistics.<\/p>\n<p>Spend on partnerships that exist to do all the heavy lifting for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Automate onboarding<\/h2>\n<p>Merchants, if you manually upload stocks to marketplaces, you\u2019ll only be listing 50 out of 1,000 products. Likewise, for marketplaces, there are so many other things to worry about and prepare for that there isn\u2019t enough time to manually onboard sellers. Mountains of product data will come in and marketplaces need to restructure it to optimize for search.<\/p>\n<p>Onboarding should be outsourced and completely automated. Only quality control (QC) should be manually operated. This way, you\u2019ll be able to get new merchants onboard in a matter of hours, not days.<\/p>\n<h2>Sync stock to avoid sell-out<\/h2>\n<p>The worst case scenario for any ecommerce platform isn\u2019t a lack of customers, it\u2019s a lack of stock when demand is high. Calling up a customer to offer vouchers or refunds is expensive and time-consuming.<\/p>\n<p>APAC\u00a0gift-focused ecommerce platform\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.giftslessordinary.com\">Gifts\u00a0Less\u00a0Ordinary<\/a>\u00a0got a wake-up call on the need for stock syncing when one of their items was worn by Prince George during Obama\u2019s visit with the Royal family. At the time, the retailer, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.my1styears.com\/\">My 1st Years<\/a>, was selling exclusively with them. As a result, orders poured in faster than the platform\u2019s founder, Amy Read, expected.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">The worst case scenario for any\u00a0ecommerce\u00a0platform isn\u2019t a lack of customers, it\u2019s a lack of stock when demand is high.<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe were getting orders every five minutes,\u201d she says. \u201cThe product, however, is configurable and customizable, so we can\u2019t mass produce these items.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWithin two days the stock syncing platform we connected with linked to the availability provided by the supplier [\u2026] the website automatically displayed when items were low in stock, out of stock, and alerted customers when the next shipment would come in.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Expect an increase in mobile sales<\/h2>\n<p>Last year, 70 percent of purchases made on<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.alibabagroup.com\/en\/double11\/detail\"> Alibaba<\/a> were on mobile, and we\u2019re seeing the same trend across Southeast Asia. Make sure your site is optimized for mobile if you don\u2019t already have an app with an integrated shopping cart.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no greater sense of panic for online shoppers than snagging an in-demand item in their shopping cart only to have the checkout frozen or failing to load. Prior to days with expected high traffic, make sure the mobile site or app has enough bandwidth to handle large amounts of orders.<\/p>\n<p>With Amazon Web Services, you can actually scale your data plan up and down depending on how busy you think you\u2019ll be.<\/p>\n<h2>Beef up the logistics team<\/h2>\n<p>The logistics team will be the hardest hit during these times. Take some weight off of your existing provider by crowdsourcing drivers with resources like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gogovan.sg\">GogoVan<\/a> in Singapore and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.deliveree.com\/id\/\">Deliveree<\/a> in Indonesia.

      "content": "\n<p>Dealing with the reality of death is something most, if not all, of us don\u2019t want to face. And for a long time, we had only two real options: burial or cremation. Nowadays, thanks to the morbidity of modern science and technology, you have a veritable mausoleum of options for your after-death residence \u2014 if you have the stomach and the cash that is.<\/p>\n<p>Here are twelve space age burial options.<\/p>\n<h2>Resomation<\/h2>\n<p>Currently, only a few <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/resomation.com\">funeral homes<\/a> offer resomation \u2014 or what they call \u201cbio-cremation.\u201d It\u2019s an eco-friendly alternative to traditional cremation because it uses lower rates of energy. Resomation is a process which uses a mixture of water and potassium hydroxide to liquefy the body, leaving only the bones. These are later ground into fragments, similar to regular cremation, then given to the family.<\/p>\n<p>Gas-powered cremation requires a massive output of energy and releases CO2 and potentially harmful residues like mercury from tooth fillings. This is why many people prefer a more environmentally-conscious way to dispose of their remains.<\/p>\n<p>Resomation only requires 350 degrees Fahrenheit to operate, and any implants or medical residues can be extracted from the bones before the sterile water is disposed of.<\/p>\n<p>However, don\u2019t look for much of a price break by being liquefied: both cremation and resomation stand at about US$3,000 total.<\/p>\n<h2>Eternal reefs<\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_364147\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-364147\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/41250497_l.jpg\" alt=\"A regular coral reef. Photo credit: mychadre77 \/ 123RF Stock Photo.\" width=\"2507\" height=\"1673\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A regular coral reef. Photo credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.123rf.com\/profile_mychadre77\">mychadre77 \/ 123RF Stock Photo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eternalreefs.com\/contact-us\/\">Georgia-based company<\/a> created a manmade reef out of a combination of cement and \u201ccremains\u201d (that\u2019s ashes). It is then submerged in a spot where natural reefs have eroded, attracting fish and other organisms to begin rebuilding their underwater neighborhood, so to speak.<\/p>\n<p>It still requires high-energy outputs, but since it replenishes the ocean floor, it certainly counts as eco-friendly. The reefs are estimated to support marine life for up to five centuries.<\/p>\n<h2>Life gem<\/h2>\n<p>Now, you can have the permanent sparkle you always wanted! Cubic zirconia is made by compressing minerals into a brilliant diamond shape. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lifegem.com\">This method<\/a> uses your ashes to create the gem.<\/p>\n<p>Not only are multiple colors available for this method (birthstone anyone?), but they can be placed into settings and thus worn as rings or other jewelry.<\/p>\n<p>As a life gem, you\u2019ll never be apart from a loved one (or several, I suppose, if they all want matching ones).<\/p>\n<h2>Space burial<\/h2>\n<p>The idea of spending eternity floating in space might not appeal to people who prefer gravity and stability as opposed to black nothingness, but for sci-fi diehards, it\u2019s now possible <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/elysiumspace.com\">to be buried in space<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This varies depending on cost and availability. One common method is for some of your ashes to be taken up in a ship that\u2019s already headed for space. However, the cost of spaceflight is already exorbitant, so current standards dictate only less than 0.25 ounces can actually be put on the ship. Maybe it\u2019s the thought that counts even in death?<\/p>\n<p>Other options include a \u201clow-orbit journey\u201d that takes you from Earth and back (nearly US$1,000). But for those who simply must leave Earth, never to return, some companies allow ashes to be shot to the moon or into deep space for US$10,000 and up.<\/p>\n<h2>Mummification<\/h2>\n<p>What was once only available to the likes of King Tut is now available to anyone with a generous life insurance policy. The modern mummification movement began in the mid-1970s with Summum, an organization founded by Corky Ra.<\/p>\n<p>If cryogenics advocates think freezing is the eventual key to reanimation, modern \u201cmummifiers,\u201d much like their ancient Egyptian counterparts, are convinced that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.summum.us\/mummification\/\">mummification<\/a> provides the key to a happy afterlife (and possible resuscitation).<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, the service is also offered for pets.<\/p>\n<p>Costs for the service run at about US$65,000, which is a major source of income for the donor-supported organization. Corky himself was mummified after his death in 2008, and his gold-covered casket remains in the Summum headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah.<\/p>\n<h2>3D printing<\/h2>\n<p>As with many forms of modern tech, 3D printing is becoming a hit worldwide. And now, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/inhabitat.com\/artist-uses-3d-printer-to-turn-human-ashes-into-objects\/\">some plucky designer has applied 3D printing to human remains<\/a>. This process uses human ashes instead of other materials, allowing you (or what is left of you) to become a real physical replica of your iPhone, car, or favorite pet.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe this is the gift to finally get for that person who has everything. After all, they can\u2019t possibly have themselves in the shape of a prize-winning hydrangea, now can they?<\/p>\n<h2>Plastination<\/h2>\n<p>Plastination finds its roots with, anatomist, Gunther von Hagens\u2019 tinkerings. He initially designed it to be used by medical professionals. He believed their research and instruction could benefit from the way the method preserves the various tissues of the body in a humanoid form. (It removes fats and other elements, replacing them with durable plastic.)<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_364151\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-364151\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.techinasia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/2252443224_64e5b31591_b.jpg\" alt=\"A cadaver that has gone through Professor Gunther von Hagens' Plastination process. Photo credit: Paul Stevenson.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"667\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A plastinated cadaver. Photo credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/pss\/2252443224\">Paul Stevenson<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>But von Hagens has since created <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bodyworlds.com\/en.html\">a series of exhibits<\/a> that displayed plastinated bodies performing various daily activities. This has literally thousands of people requesting for their own bodies to be plastinated for educational and display purposes. Some have criticized this as little more than \u201chuman taxidermy,\u201d but others find it fascinating and instructive.<\/p>\n<h2>Natural burial<\/h2>\n<p>This is very similar to conventional burial in a graveyard. However, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.beatree.com\">natural burial<\/a> has some major differences: no embalming fluid is used at any time, and the concrete vault that lines most graves is dispensed with. The corpse is wound in a shroud or placed in a biodegradable coffin to facilitate natural (and fairly quick) decomposition.<\/p>\n<p>The trend began in the late 1990s, with the opening of the first entirely-natural cemetery, Ramsey Creek, in Westminster, South Carolina. Today, more than fifty are scattered all over the United States.<\/p>\n<p>With the lack of foreign chemicals and other potentially harmful effects of modern burial, cemeteries can become nature reserves. The idea that they are contributing to the flourishing of the natural world is an incentive for many to choose this method.<\/p>\n<h2>Cryonics<\/h2>\n<p>Also known as the burial option for the pretentious and obscenely rich, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cryonics.org\">cryonics<\/a> is rooted in the belief that if the body is frozen, it can be reanimated in the future with the memories and personality unharmed.<\/p>\n<p>This is a rather controversial method of after-death care, and could possibly be counter-intuitive because the chemicals used in the procedure are thought to be toxic. Still, approximately 200 people have signed up to be frozen across the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>Prices vary widely based on the particular company, but averages for whole-body freezing run upwards of US$200,000, while just freezing your head will set you back only US$80,000.<\/p>\n<h2>Vinyl<\/h2>\n<p>If you can be turned into jewelry, then Vinyly is a company that might do you one better \u2014 turn you into music! <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencetech\/article-2381244\/And-Vinyly-make-vinyl-records-cremation-ASHES.html\">Your very own cremains get pressed into a vinyl record<\/a>, giving you a vintage touch that will also be an instant conversation piece for your family members.<\/p>\n<p>Not to be outdone for versatility, the company even offers its own in-house band to take requests for the record. You can record things like a goodbye message, your will, or your favorite song. (I do wonder if the record\u2019s spinning means this option is not for the easily nauseated.)<\/p>\n<h2>Freeze-drying<\/h2>\n<p>The brainchild of a Swedish marine biologist, \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.promessa.se\">promession<\/a>\u201d or freeze-drying immerses the body in liquid nitrogen, which makes the body brittle. The body is then vibrated, disintegrated, and vacuumed away.<\/p>\n<p>A mechanical separator removes any medical implants or fillings, and the powdery remains are laid to rest in a shallow grave. As of yet, no one has chosen this exit route. However, the company does have a licensed branch available in the United Kingdom, and it\u2019s likely that interest in the method as a green alternative will grow.<\/p>\n<h2>Ash pencils<\/h2>\n<p>Perfect for the budding or accomplished writer, designer Nadine Jarvis has created a handsome box set of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dailyundertaker.com\/2009\/02\/nadine-jarvis-post-mortem.html\">pencils made entirely from human ash<\/a>. On average, a cremated human body produces enough ash to create 240 pencils, and the box is specially designed to release only one at a time.<\/p>\n<p>The sharpener is located on the side of the box, which will contain the excess shavings. When the last pencil is used up, the box becomes a defacto urn. Morbid? Perhaps.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>If burial or cremation aren\u2019t your cups of tea for your big sleep, surely one of these options will fit your budget and, doubtlessly, quirky personality. And if it doesn\u2019t, you can always invest in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/burialinsurancecoverage.com\">burial insurance<\/a> or just wait until some renegade techie in Silicon Valley will come up with something better.<\/p>\n",
